This is a basic blackjack game created with html, css, and javascript. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by scoring 21 points; reaching a final score higher than the dealer without going over 21; or letting the dealer draw additional cards until the dealer exceeds 21.

Game uses one standard deck of cards. The Player has the option to Hit or Stand.

Player rules:
Hit: Take another card from dealer.
Stand: Player takes no more cards and dealer draws card(s).

Dealer rules:
Dealer hits until the cards total is 17 or more points.

A tied score is known as a "Push".

After each hand, click on the New Game button to start a New Game.

A Status Area was added to show the status of each move made by the Player and the Dealer. It also shows who won, or if there was a Push.

I enjoyed making my first game. I learned a lot about using loops and if/else statements to render the cards and create the rules for the game.
